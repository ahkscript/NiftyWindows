<h2>FEATURES</h2>

<p>The main idea of this tool was triggered by my nice colleague Mark. He is a confirmed Linux user since his very early 
teens. So he'll always start to rail against the tricky window handling implemented in Redmond, WA if he is pained to 
use some widespread software products.</p>

<p>The main intention of NiftyWindows is the provision of an easy user control of all basic window interactions like 
dragging, resizing, maximizing, minimizing, closing and many others. The idea is to perform the central interactions 
with a single hand without any need to press some tricky key combinations like other tools or window managers enforce.
<br />One of the mostly unused mouse features is the press and drag of the 
<i><span class="trigger">RIGHT_BUTTON</span></i>. Therefore this mouse action is used for the main features as explained 
below. The superior principle is to keep all features efficient but simple.</p>

<p><span class="note">Note</span>: The basic window interactions mentioned above cannot be applied to all windows because 
there are some special treatments (e.g. context menus or maximized windows). If you really like to enforce the power of 
NiftyWindows to these windows also, you can press (and hold) <i><span class="modifier">CTRL</span></i> 
<strong>before</strong> you start using a certain feature to manipulate these windows as well. With this forced mode 
you can drag and resize the given (see below) "special windows" (makes sense) as well as adjust the bounds of context 
menus and other (naturally) unchangeable GUI components (be careful).</p>

<p>During the development process many innovative ideas came up (and were implemented certainly). So we had to choose 
further keys to provide some simple trigger combinations to you. We decided to use the four most left-bottom keys 
(<i><span class="trigger">WIN</span></i>, <i><span class="trigger">CTRL</span></i>, 
<i><span class="trigger">SHIFT</span></i>, <i><span class="trigger">ALT</span></i>) on your keyboard as trigger 
combination only, to keep it simple.</p>

<p>The following list contains many features and modifiers. A modifier is used in combination with a feature 
action to provide some additional control. If there are more than one modifier specified for a single feature, 
certainly all of the given modifiers are freely combinable to provide the maximum flexibility in all situations.</p>

<p>This tool provides the following features to significantly improve the user-interface-flow:</p>

<ul class="triggerlist">
	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE</span></i></li>
	<li><i><span class="triggermultidef">CTRL+WIN+BACKSPACE</span></i>
		<br />This powerful hotkey removes <strong>all</strong> visual effects (like on exit) that have been made before 
		by NiftyWindows. You can use this action as a fall-back solution to quickly revert any always-on-top, 
		rolled windows and transparency features you've set before.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: This hotkey is particularly important during your test stage to revert some 
		nifty visual effects after you completed a single feature test and before you're going to test the next. So 
		keep it in mind!</p>
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">RIGHT_BUTTON+DRAG</span></i>
		<br />This is the most powerful feature of NiftyWindows. The area of every window is tiled in a virtual 9-cell 
		grid with three columns and rows. The center cell is the largest one and you can grab and move a window around 
		by clicking and holding it with the right mouse button. The other eight corner cells are used to resize a 
		resizable window in the same manner.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: This drag and resize feature is not provided on some certain windows because 
		this mouse behaviour may have a special handling controlled by the application itself. You can use the forced 
		mode (see explanation in the introduction of 'features') to manipulate these windows as well. Currently the 
		following windows (and its possible child windows) have been taken into account:</p>

		<p>Windows Explorer; Cabinet; Internet Explorer; Mozilla/Firefox; Opera; Xplore</p>

		<p /><ul class="modifierlist">
			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">CTRL+RIGHT_BUTTON+DRAG</span></i>
				<br />This modifier enables the forced mode for this action as described in the introduction of 
				'features'.
			<p /></li>

			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">SHIFT+RIGHT_BUTTON+DRAG</span></i>
				<br />This modifier lets the window bounds snap to a virtual 10 pixel grid to ease window alignment and 
				to allow a complex window arrangement.
			<p /></li>

			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">WIN+RIGHT_BUTTON+DRAG</span></i>
				<br />This modifier lets you resize all four edges of a window in a symmetrical manner around the 
				window center.
			<p /></li>

			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">ALT+RIGHT_BUTTON+DRAG</span></i>
				<br />This modifier locks the width and height ratio (aka aspect ratio) during the resize operation.
			<p /></li>
		</ul><p />
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">RIGHT_BUTTON+LEFT_BUTTON</span></i>
		<br />Minimizes the selected window (if minimizable) to the task bar. If you press the left button over the 
		titlebar the selected window will be rolled up instead of being minimized. You have to apply this action again 
		to roll the window back down.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: If you exit NiftyWindows all rolled windows will be unrolled first.</p>

		<p /><ul class="modifierlist">
			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">CTRL+RIGHT_BUTTON+LEFT_BUTTON</span></i>
				<br />This modifier enables the forced mode for this action as described in the introduction of 
				'features'.
			<p /></li>
		</ul><p />
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">CTRL+WIN+R</span></i>
		<br />Unrolls all windows (like on exit) that have been rolled up before by NiftyWindows.
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">RIGHT_BUTTON+MIDDLE_BUTTON</span></i>
		<br />Closes the selected window (if closeable) as if you click the close button in the titlebar. If you press 
		the middle button over the titlebar the selected window will be sent to the bottom of the window stack instead 
		of being closed.

		<p /><ul class="modifierlist">
			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">CTRL+RIGHT_BUTTON+MIDDLE_BUTTON</span></i>
				<br />This modifier enables the forced mode for this action as described in the introduction of 
				'features'.
			<p /></li>
		</ul><p />
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">RIGHT_BUTTON+WHEEL</span></i>
		<br />Provides a quick task switcher (alt-tab-menu) controlled by the mouse wheel.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: If you like task switching by using the alt-tab-menu you should give 
		Microsoft's 'Alt-Tab Replacement' (part of the PowerToys) a try. With this PowerToy, in addition to seeing 
		the icon of the application window you are switching to, you will also see a preview of the page. This helps 
		particularly when multiple sessions of an application are open.</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx</a></p>
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">MIDDLE_BUTTON</span></i>
		<br />Initiates a double click.
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">FOURTH_BUTTON</span></i>
		<br />This additional button is used to toggle the windows start menu.
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">FIFTH_BUTTON</span></i>
		<br />This additional button is used to toggle the maximize state of the active window (if maximizable).

		<p /><ul class="modifierlist">
			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">CTRL+FIFTH_BUTTON</span></i>
				<br />This modifier enables the forced mode for this action as described in the introduction of 
				'features'.
			<p /></li>
		</ul><p />
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">WIN+0..9</span></i>
		<br />Opens or closes an installed CD/DVD-ROM reader/writer drive tray. The drives are assigned to their hotkeys 
		by the certain drive number in your system. The hotkeys are used in the sequence of the key placement on your 
		physical keyboard from left to right (1 refers to the first and 0 to the tenth drive). So you are limited to a 
		total number of 10 drives controlled by NiftyWindows.

		<p><span class="example">Example</span>: If you press <i><span class="trigger">WIN+1</span></i> the first drive found 
		(ordered by their drive letters) will be opened or closed (depends on the current state).</p>

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: During the open or close operation NiftyWindows is suspended (and waiting) so 
		you can control only a single drive per time. If you want to open or close more than one drive you have to do 
		it sequentially.</p>
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">PAUSE</span></i>
		<br />Toggles the muteness of an installed audio card.
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">WIN+S</span></i>
		<br />Starts the user defined screensaver (password protection aware).
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">CTRL+WIN+S</span></i>
		<br />This does the same as the feature described above with the addition that the display(s) will be powered 
		down shortly (five seconds) after the screensaver started successfully. This feature is very useful if you 
		already know that you are going to leave the system for a long period of time.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: If you perform any user input that ends the saver in the first seconds 
		certainly the display(s) will not be powered down. After the display(s) were powered down you can wake them up by 
		any key or mouse inputs as well known.</p>
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">WIN+LEFT_BUTTON</span></i></li>
	<li><i><span class="triggermultidef">WIN+^</span></i>
		<br />Toggles the always-on-top attribute of the selected/active window.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: If you exit NiftyWindows any always-on-top attributes will be removed first.</p>
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">CTRL+WIN+^</span></i>
		<br />Removes any always-on-top attributes (like on exit) that have been set before by NiftyWindows.
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">WIN+WHEEL</span></i>
		<br />Adjusts the transparency of the active window in ten percent steps (opaque = 100%) which allows the 
		contents of the windows behind it to shine through. If the window is completely transparent (0%) the window is 
		still there and clickable. If you loose a transparent window it will be extremly complicated to find it again 
		because it's invisible (see the first hotkey in this list for emergency help in such situations).

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: This mode is called window-transparency. This feature is only supported on 
		Windows 2000/XP or later and needs a powerful processor and video card installed in your system. If you exit 
		NiftyWindows any transparency effects will be removed first.</p>

		<p /><ul class="modifierlist">
			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">SHIFT+WIN+WHEEL</span></i>
				<br />This modifier decreases the percent steps to one (instead of ten) for a more accurate control.
			<p /></li>
		</ul><p />
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">WIN+CTRL+LEFT_BUTTON</span></i>
		<br />Makes all pixels of the same color the mouse cursor points at invisible inside the target window, which 
		allows the contents of the windows behind it to show through. If the user clicks on an invisible pixel, the 
		click will "fall through" to the window behind it. You should always be concentrated by using this feature. 
		Otherwise you can loose some windows completely (see the first hotkey in this list for emergency help in such 
		situations).

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: This mode is called pixel-transparency. This feature is only supported on 
		Windows 2000/XP or later and needs a powerful processor and video card installed in your system. If you exit 
		NiftyWindows any transparency effects will be removed first.</p>
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">WIN+CTRL+MIDDLE_BUTTON</span></i>
		<br />Provides a special combination of multiple features (window-transparency &amp; pixel-transparency &amp; 
		always-on-top). This action is intended to be used on small dialogs (e.g. file-copy or download with progress 
		bar). By using this feature you can modify an important dialog to stay inside your field of vision all the time 
		without affecting your concentration. You have to revert these changes manually by using the well known 
		features of NiftyWindows (see the first hotkey in this list for emergency help in such situations).

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: This mode combines 25% window-transparency and the pixel-transparency (pixel 
		color at mouse click position). These features are only supported on Windows 2000/XP or later and needs a 
		powerful processor and video card installed in your system. If you exit NiftyWindows any transparency effects 
		will be removed first.</p>
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">WIN+MIDDLE_BUTTON</span></i>
		<br />Removes any transparency effects (windows- as well as pixel-transparency) of the selected window.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: If you use pixel transparency you have to click on any remaining visible part 
		of the window otherwise the action is catched by the window behind it as described above.</p>
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">CTRL+WIN+T</span></i>
		<br />Removes any transparency effects (like on exit) that have been set before by NiftyWindows.
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">ALT+WHEEL</span></i>
		<br />Changes the size of the active window in ten percent steps which allows a very quick resize operation with 
		simply two snatches.

		<p /><ul class="modifierlist">
			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">CTRL+ALT+WHEEL</span></i>
				<br />This modifier enables the forced mode for this action as described in the introduction of 
				'features'.
			<p /></li>

			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">SHIFT+ALT+WHEEL</span></i>
				<br />This modifier decreases the percent steps to one (instead of ten) for a more accurate control.
			<p /></li>

			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">WIN+ALT+WHEEL</span></i>
				<br />This modifier lets you resize all four edges of a window in a symmetrical manner around the 
				window center.
			<p /></li>
		</ul><p />
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">ALT+NumAdd</span></i></li>
	<li><i><span class="triggermultidef">ALT+NumSub</span></i>
		<br />Changes the size of the active window in steps of the standard screen resolutions. 
		<i><span class="trigger">ALT+NumAdd</span></i> increases to the next higher, 
		<i><span class="trigger">ALT+NumSub</span></i> decreases to the previous lower standard resolution. This feature 
		is very useful for testing web pages: you can easily set your browser window to any common screen resolution.

		<p /><ul class="modifierlist">
			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">CTRL+ALT+NumAdd</span></i></li>
			<li><i><span class="modifiermultidef">CTRL+ALT+NumSub</span></i>
				<br />This modifier enables the forced mode for this action as described in the introduction of 
				'features'.
			<p /></li>
		</ul><p />
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">WIN+F1..F24</span></i>
		<br />Activates the next window in a process window group that was defined gradually before with the given 
		<i><span class="modifier">CTRL</span></i> modifier. This feature causes the first window of the responsible 
		group to be activated. Using it a second time will activate the next window in the series and so on. By using 
		process window groups you can organize and access your process windows in semantic groups quickly.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: When a window is activated immediately after another window was activated, 
		the task bar buttons may start flashing on some systems (depending on OS and settings).</p>

		<p /><ul class="modifierlist">
			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">CTRL+WIN+F1..F24</span></i>
				<br />This modifier adds all windows of the active process to the responsible group.
			<p /></li>

			<li><i><span class="modifierdef">ALT+WIN+F1..F24</span></i>
				<br />This modifier closes <strong>all</strong> windows of the responsible group.
			<p /></li>
		</ul><p />
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">WIN+ESC</span></i>
		<br />By pressing this hotkey you can disable (and reenable) all NiftyWindows mouse and keyboard features at 
		once. This is commonly used when you're going to start a special application that handles some triggers itself 
		or when you want to temporarily disable NiftyWindows.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: There is an auto suspend mode that can be enabled/disabled in the tray icon 
		menu. This auto mode disables NiftyWindows temporarily as soon as a fullscreen window (propably a 3D game) was 
		activated (gain focus). After the fullscreen window was deactivated (lost focus) NiftyWindows is enabled 
		again.</p>
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">WIN+X</span></i>
		<br />Exits NiftyWindows.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: If the tray icon is hidden this hotkey will show it again (if it is already 
		visible NiftyWindows will exit as expected).</p>
	<p /></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>The following features are less common because they depend on special applications and tools which 
<strong>may</strong> be installed on your system:</p>

<ul class="triggerlist">
	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">CTRL+SHIFT+B</span></i>
		<br />Toggles the visibility of the Miranda buddy list (if installed). Currently Miranda does not provide a 
		hotkey to activate the buddy list if the window is still visible. Instead the opened (but not activated) buddy 
		list will be minimized. This is not expected so this NiftyWindows feature provides the needed service asked 
		by so many people:

		<p /><ul>
			<li>If Miranda's buddy list window is visible but not activated the window will be activated by pressing 
			this hotkey.</li>
			<li>If the buddy list is visible and activated the window will be minimized.</li>
			<li>If the buddy list is minimized the window will be made visible and activated.</li>
			<li>If Miranda is not started at all it will be started and the buddy list will be made visible and 
			activated.</li>
		</ul><p />

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: This feature is only applied if the Miranda executable can be found at: 
		%ProgramFiles%\Miranda\Miranda32.exe</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.miranda-im.org/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">http://www.miranda-im.org/</a></p>

		<p>As soon as this service will be provided by Miranda itself this hotkey will be removed from NiftyWindows.</p>
	<p /></li>

	<li><i><span class="triggerdef">CTRL+SHIFT+U</span></i>
		<br />Toggles the visibility of the last used Miranda message container (if installed). Currently Miranda 
		does not provide a hotkey to activate the last used message container if there is no unread message waiting for 
		your attention. So this hotkey will make a container visible (if it is minimized) and activate it. If there is 
		no existing message container, this hotkey will do nothing.

		<p><span class="note">Note</span>: The message container identification is done by its window class only. So it 
		may be that there are further windows having the same class that will be triggered by this hotkey also. There 
		is currently no other way to do this. But you can inform us about some wrongly triggered window titles to 
		exclude them from this hotkey in particular. Currently the following window titles have been taken into account:</p>

		<p>Mail</p>

		<p>This feature is only applied if the Miranda executable can be found at: %ProgramFiles%\Miranda\Miranda32.exe</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.miranda-im.org/" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">http://www.miranda-im.org/</a></p>

		<p>As soon as this service will be provided by Miranda itself this hotkey will be removed from NiftyWindows.</p>
